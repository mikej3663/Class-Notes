## Important Notes and Information from the Textbook
 
Michael Jamesley


Three key takeaways from chapter 2:

1. Automate everything that can be automated
        - It is important to not *raw code* everything, make sure the code works for different data sets
2. ABCD = Always Be Checking your Data
        - When coding, constantly **use print statements** to check if your data makes sense
3. Store cleaned data in tables with unique and representative names
        - Data should be cleaned under a name that makes sense for the data
